This application provides a bare bones example of a React frontend application and a Node.js backend application
used for pinging a minecraft server to retrieve available public information such as player count, MOTD, favicon. 

This project uses another project: mcpingjs to handle the majority of the pinging portion of the code. 

This frontend also is just a basic VITE starter application and console logs to perform actions.
